    question: "Is Movmash free to use?",
    answer: "Yes! Movmash is completely free to use. Create rooms, invite friends, and watch together without any subscription or payment required.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do my friends need to create an account?",
    answer: "Friends can join and watch without creating an account. However, creating a room or being the host requires signing in with Google for a seamless experience.",
  },
  {
    question: "What platforms can I watch together?",
    answer: "Movmash supports YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, Dailymotion, HLS streams, and more. You can also share your screen to watch Netflix, Disney+, or any other streaming service together.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does screen sharing work?",
    answer: "In Stream mode, you can share your browser tab, application window, or entire screen. For best audio quality, we recommend sharing a browser tab. Everyone in the room will see and hear exactly what you're sharing.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I watch local video files with friends?",
    answer: "Absolutely! In Stream mode, you can upload video files from your computer and stream them to everyone in the room. Your files stay on your computer — we don't store them on our servers.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a limit on room participants?",
    answer: "Currently, Movmash supports multiple participants in each room. For the best experience, we recommend keeping rooms under 50 participants.",
  },
  {
    question: "What browsers are supported?",
    answer: "Movmash works best on modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. For screen sharing features, we recommend using Chrome or Edge for the best audio capture support.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data private and secure?",
    answer: "Yes, we take privacy seriously. Rooms are private by default — only people with the room link can join. We don't store your video files, and all communications are encrypted.",
